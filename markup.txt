Quotes:
=======
To quote somebody else's text, place it on its own line with quote marks at the beginning and end.
This applies even if the quoted text is more than one paragraph, or contains quotes itself.

Examples:

There must be a blank line between any quote and other text

YES:	This is my text
	
	"This is your text"
	
	This is my text

A single line-break does not work.

NO:	This is my text
	"This is your text"
	
	This is my text

There must be no text before or after the quote marks.

NO:	"This is your text".
	
However, spaces before or after are allowed. When you copy and paste someone else's quote,
extra spaces might be added, just ignore these.

YES:	This is my text

	     "this is your text
	
	"
	
	This is my text

A quote may span more than one line or paragraph

YES:	This is my text
	
	"The quick brown fox
	jumped over the lazy dog
	
	Jackdaws love my big
	sphinx of quartz"
	
	This is my text

Quotes can contain quotes

YES:	"This is the first quote
	
	"This is the second quote"
	
	This is the first quote"
	
You may use three different kinds of quote marks

YES:	"Plain speech marks"

	“Curly quotes”
	
	«Guillemots»

But you can’t mismatch the ends:

NO	“this won’t work»

Different kinds of quotes can be nested however

YES:	"This is the first quote

	“This is the second quote
	
	«This is a third quote»”"


Pre-formatted (Monospace) Text and Code:
========================================
When posting, all unnecessary whitespace is automatically removed.
If you have some text that you need to present "as-is", or relies upon a
monospace font (such as ASCII art), you can use a "code block", like so:

%
      __...--~~~~~-._   _.-~~~~~--...__
    //               `V'               \\ 
   //                 |                 \\ 
  //__...--~~~~~~-._  |  _.-~~~~~~--...__\\ 
 //__.....----~~~~._\ | /_.~~~~----.....__\\
====================\\|//====================
                dwb `---`
%

The code block begins with a percent sign, then your text (starting the next line),
and then the ending percent sign on the next line.

There should be a blank line between the code block and any other text before or after.

NO:	Fish!
	%
	<*###><
	%
	
YES:	Fish!

	%
	<*###><
	%

You can include a title, or in the instance of inserting source code snippets,
the programming language used after the first percent sign:

% CSS
div	{color: red;}
%

% Fish!
<*###><
%

Should you need to quote something that has percent symbols as the first character on a line,
such as the LaTeX programming language, you can simply use the dollar sign "$" as a delimiter instead.
